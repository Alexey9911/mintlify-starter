Every entity in the CryptoGuard ecosystem receives a risk score from 0 to 100. This score aggregates multiple data points into a single, actionable metric.

## Score Ranges

| Score | Level | Color | Recommendation |
|-------|-------|-------|----------------|
| 0-20 | Safe | 🟢 Green | Proceed normally |
| 21-40 | Low Risk | 🟢 Green | Minor caution advised |
| 41-60 | Medium Risk | 🟡 Yellow | Review before proceeding |
| 61-80 | High Risk | 🟠 Orange | Strong caution, verify manually |
| 81-100 | Critical | 🔴 Red | Do not interact |

## API Usage

### Get Contract Risk Score

```typescript
const score = await cryptoguard.risk.getScore({
  chain: 'ethereum',
  address: '0x...',
  type: 'contract'
});

console.log(score);
// {
//   "overall": 34,
//   "breakdown": {
//     "codeAnalysis": 15,
//     "ownershipRisk": 45,
//     "liquidityHealth": 20,
//     "historicalActivity": 30,
//     "communitySignals": 50,
//     "auditStatus": 10
//   },
//   "confidence": 0.87
// }
```

### Get Wallet Risk Score

```typescript
const score = await cryptoguard.risk.getScore({
  chain: 'ethereum',
  address: '0x...',
  type: 'wallet'
});
```

### Pre-Transaction Risk Analysis

```typescript
const analysis = await cryptoguard.risk.analyzeTransaction({
  from: '0x...',
  to: '0x...',
  data: '0x...',
  value: '1000000000000000000'
});

if (analysis.overall > 70) {
  console.warn('High risk transaction!', analysis.warnings);
}
```

## Risk Score History

CryptoGuard tracks risk score changes over time:

```typescript
const history = await cryptoguard.risk.getHistory({
  chain: 'ethereum',
  address: '0x...',
  period: '30d'
});

// Returns array of score snapshots
// [{
//   "timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
//   "overall": 25
// }, ...]
```

<Note>
  Sudden risk score increases (>20 points in 24 hours) trigger automatic alerts for tracked addresses.
</Note>

---

## Confidence Score

Each risk score includes a confidence value (0-1) indicating accuracy:

| Confidence | Meaning | Data Available |
|------------|---------|----------------|
| 0.9-1.0 | Very High | Full data, verified source, sufficient history |
| 0.7-0.9 | High | Most data available, some unverified |
| 0.5-0.7 | Medium | Partial data, new contract |
| 0.3-0.5 | Low | Limited data, analyze manually |
| 0-0.3 | Very Low | Insufficient data for reliable score |

<Warning>
  Risk scores with confidence < 0.5 should be treated as estimates. Always verify critical transactions manually.
</Warning>
